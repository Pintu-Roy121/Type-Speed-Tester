      <button class="question">Difference between local storage and session storage.</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p> <strong>sessionStorage</strong> is similar to <strong>localStorage</strong> : the difference is that while
          data in <strong>localStorage doesn't expire</strong>, data in <strong>sessionStorage is cleared</strong> when
          the page session ends. Whenever a
          document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that
          particular tab.That page session is valid only for that particular tab.A page session lasts as long as the tab
          or the browser is open, and survives over page reloads and restores. </p>
      </div>

      <button class="question">Difference between local scope and block scope.</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>When a variable is <strong>globally scoped</strong>, it means it is <strong>available from anywhere in your
            program</strong>.
          Declaring a variable outside a function or a block outside a function leads to it being globally scoped. <br>
          <strong>A block scoped</strong> variable means that the variable defined within a <strong>block will not be
            accessible from
            outside the block</strong>. A block can reside inside a function, and a block scoped variable will not be
          available outside the block even if the block is inside a function.

      <button class="question">How event loop works in javascript?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The event loop is <strong>a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from
            the Task Queue to the Call Stack. </strong> Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the
          Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack
          to be clear again, and repeats the same process. The above diagram demonstrates the basic workflow between the
          Event Loop and the Task Queue.

        4. If return has nothing on the right side will return undefined. <br>
        5. Property that doesn't exists on the object will give undefined. <br>
        6. Accessing array elements outside of the index range. <br>
        7. Deleting an element inside an array. <br>
